Aims to load specific x86-32 Maxis mac games on linux as blobs via MMAP, and replaces specific functions.

External Libraries used:
-MALoader
-DXVK
-OpenSSL
-lua (You have to download and compile Lua 5.0 yourself right now, but for compiling the sims 2 you can probably just remove the linking to lua and it'll be safe, probably)
-Mac OS X's Carbon framework (as headers; code is still reimplemented when implementing mac os functions)
